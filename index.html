            <p style="font-size: 0.75em;">Kepa is an electrical 
               engineer with a knack for problem-solving and a 
               soft spot for tech gadgets like Arduino and 
               Raspberry Pi. Since graduating from BYU in April 
               2023 with a BS in Computer Engineering, he's been putting his skills to 
               work with a defense contractor, but in his 
               spare time, he moonlights as a game developer 
               with dreams of starting his own indie studio. 
               With Google as his trusty sidekick, there's no 
               problem too tough for him to crack—unless, of 
               course, it’s convincing his friends that his 
               hobby projects aren’t just an excuse to play 
               with toys!</p>
